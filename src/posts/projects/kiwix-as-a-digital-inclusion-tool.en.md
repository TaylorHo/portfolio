### Abstract

_The precarious state of connectivity in Brazilian public schools limits the use of digital resources and undermines educational inclusion: in 2022, 58.8% of schools experienced internet instability and 20.4% had no access at all. This study evaluates Kiwix as a viable solution for providing offline educational content in contexts with limited infrastructure. The re-search validates practical implementation methods, such as the use of USB drives and direct installation, highlighting pedagogical and social benefits. The adoption of Kiwix can promote digital inclusion in approximately 70% of Brazilian schools with restricted or no internet access, representing an effective and low-cost alternative for digital education._
